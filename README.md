# Bricks MCP

AI-powered assistant for [Bricks Builder](https://bricksbuilder.io/). Control your website with natural language through MCP-compatible AI tools like Claude.

**Talk to your website. It listens.**

## What It Does

Bricks MCP is a WordPress plugin that implements an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, letting AI assistants read and write your Bricks Builder site. Connect Claude, Gemini, or any MCP-compatible client and manage pages, templates, global classes, theme styles, WooCommerce layouts, and more — all through natural language.

## Features

- 20+ MCP tools covering the full Bricks Builder data model
- Read and write pages, templates, elements, and global settings
- WooCommerce support (product pages, cart, checkout, account templates)
- Global classes, theme styles, typography scales, color palettes, variables
- Media library management with Unsplash integration
- WordPress menus, fonts, and custom code management
- Built-in connection tester and config snippet generator
- Works with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Gemini, and any MCP client

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.4+
- PHP 8.2+
- Bricks Builder 1.6+

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/buffupmedia/bricks-mcp/releases)
2. Upload to your WordPress site via Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin
3. Activate the plugin
4. Go to Settings > Bricks MCP to configure

## Connecting Your AI Tool

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add bricks-mcp https://yoursite.com/wp-json/bricks-mcp/v1/mcp --transport http
```

### Claude Desktop / Other MCP Clients

Add to your MCP config (`.mcp.json` or equivalent):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bricks-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://yoursite.com/wp-json/bricks-mcp/v1/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Basic BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Authentication uses WordPress [Application Passwords](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/11/05/application-passwords-integration-guide/) (Users > Profile > Application Passwords).

## Try It Out

Once connected, try these prompts with your AI tool. Each one exercises different MCP tools and can be used to verify the integration is working.

### Basic checks

```
What WordPress site am I connected to? What version is it running?
```

```
List all active plugins on this site.
```

```
Show me the Bricks Builder guide so I understand how to build pages.
```

### Page building

```
Create a new page called "About Us" with a hero section containing a heading
"About Our Company" and a paragraph of placeholder text below it.
```

```
Add a two-column container to the About Us page. Put a heading and text in the
left column, and an image placeholder in the right column.
```

```
List all my pages and show which ones use Bricks Builder.
```

### Global styles

```
Create a global class called "btn-primary" with 12px 24px padding, white text,
#2563eb background, 6px border radius, and 600 font weight.
```

```
Create a color palette called "Brand Colors" with: Primary #2563eb, Secondary
#7c3aed, Accent #f59e0b, and Neutral #64748b.
```

```
Create a theme style that sets all H1 headings to 48px bold and H2 to 36px
semibold.
```

### Templates

```
Create a section template called "CTA Banner" with a dark background section
containing a centered heading and a button.
```

```
List all my templates and their types.
```

### Menus

```
Create a navigation menu called "Main Menu" with links to Home (/), About
(/about/), Services (/services/), and Contact (/contact/).
```

### Advanced

```
Show me the Bricks settings and breakpoints configured on this site.
```

```
Create a typography scale with steps: xs 12px, sm 14px, base 16px, lg 20px,
xl 24px, 2xl 32px, 3xl 48px. Use the prefix --fs-.
```

```
Create a set of global CSS variables for spacing: --space-xs 4px, --space-sm
8px, --space-md 16px, --space-lg 32px, --space-xl 64px.
```

## Configuration

Go to **Settings > Bricks MCP** in WordPress admin:

- **Enable MCP Server** — toggle the server on/off
- **Require Authentication** — restrict access to authenticated users
- **Custom Base URL** — for reverse proxies or custom domains
- **Dangerous Actions** — enable write access to global Bricks settings and code execution

## Extending

Add custom tools using the `bricks_mcp_tools` filter:

```php
add_filter( 'bricks_mcp_tools', function( $tools ) {
    $tools['my_custom_tool'] = [
        'name'        => 'my_custom_tool',
        'description' => 'My custom tool description',
        'inputSchema' => [
            'type'       => 'object',
            'properties' => [],
        ],
        'handler'     => function( $args ) {
            return ['result' => 'success'];
        },
    ];
    return $tools;
});
```

## Local Development

Prerequisites: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buffupmedia/bricks-mcp.git
cd bricks-mcp
npm install
npm run start
```

That's it. The first start takes a few minutes to download WordPress and set up the containers. Composer dependencies are installed automatically inside the containers.

Local site: http://localhost:8888 (admin / password)

### Available Commands

```bash
npm run start        # Start WordPress environment (Docker via wp-env)
npm run stop         # Stop the environment
npm run test         # Run all PHPUnit tests
npm run test:unit    # Run unit tests only
npm run lint         # WordPress coding standards check
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run wp <command> # Run WP-CLI commands
npm run logs:watch   # Tail the PHP debug log
```

### How It Works

The dev environment uses [@wordpress/env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) (wp-env), which runs WordPress in Docker containers. The plugin directory is mounted directly into the container, so file changes are reflected immediately.

A [mu-plugin](mu-plugins/wp-env-fixes.php) is included to fix Docker networking quirks (REST API loopback and Application Passwords over HTTP).
