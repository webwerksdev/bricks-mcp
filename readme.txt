Connect AI assistants like Claude to your Bricks Builder site. Build and edit pages using natural language — no clicking required.

== Description ==

Bricks MCP turns your WordPress site into an AI-controlled page builder. It implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) — an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools — so that any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and others) can read and modify your Bricks Builder pages through plain conversation.

Tell your AI assistant "create a hero section with a headline and a call-to-action button" and it happens. No template hunting. No clicking through panels.

= How It Works =

The plugin registers a REST API endpoint on your WordPress site that speaks the MCP protocol. You add the endpoint URL to your AI client's MCP configuration, authenticate with a WordPress Application Password, and your AI can start working with your site immediately.

= Available Tools =

* **get_site_info** — Retrieve site name, description, URL, and active theme
* **get_posts** — List posts and pages with filtering and pagination
* **get_post** — Fetch the full content of any post or page
* **get_users** — List WordPress users
* **get_plugins** — List installed and active plugins
* **get_bricks_page** — Read the full Bricks Builder element tree for any page
* **get_builder_guide** — Fetch the built-in builder reference guide for AI context
* **search_media** — Search for images via the Unsplash API (requires your own Unsplash API key)
* **create_bricks_page** — Create a new page with a complete Bricks Builder layout
* **update_bricks_page** — Modify the element tree of an existing Bricks Builder page
* **delete_bricks_element** — Remove a specific element from a page

All tools are free to use. The plugin is open source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/cristianuibar/bricks-mcp).

= Authentication =

All requests are authenticated using WordPress Application Passwords, the built-in authentication system available since WordPress 5.6. No third-party authentication service is involved.

= Requirements =

* WordPress 6.4 or later
* PHP 8.2 or later
* Bricks Builder theme 1.6 or later (required for Bricks-specific tools)

= Getting Started =

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Go to **Settings > Bricks MCP** and enable the plugin.
3. Create a WordPress Application Password under **Users > Profile**.
4. Add the MCP server URL to your AI client configuration.
5. Start building pages with natural language.

Full setup documentation is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cristianuibar/bricks-mcp).

== External Services ==

This plugin optionally connects to the Unsplash API to search for images.

**Service:** Unsplash (api.unsplash.com)
**When used:** Only when the `search_media` tool is called by an AI assistant, and only if you have configured an Unsplash API key in the plugin settings.
**What is sent:** Your search query string and your Unsplash API key.
**Unsplash Terms of Service:** https://unsplash.com/terms
**Unsplash Privacy Policy:** https://unsplash.com/privacy
**Unsplash API Guidelines:** https://unsplash.com/documentation

No data is sent to Unsplash unless you explicitly configure an API key and an AI assistant invokes the image search tool.

No other external services are contacted by this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `bricks-mcp` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin via the WordPress Plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in WordPress.
3. Navigate to **Settings > Bricks MCP** to configure the plugin.
4. Enable the MCP server and optionally require authentication (strongly recommended for production sites).
5. Go to **Users > Your Profile** and scroll to **Application Passwords**. Create a new Application Password and copy it — you will need it for your AI client.
6. Add your site's MCP endpoint URL and credentials to your AI client (see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cristianuibar/bricks-mcp) for client-specific setup guides).
7. (Optional) Enter an Unsplash API key in the settings to enable image search.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)? =

MCP is an open protocol created by Anthropic that gives AI assistants a standard way to connect to external tools and data sources. It works like a universal adapter: the AI client connects to an MCP server, discovers what tools are available, and calls them by name. This plugin implements that server for WordPress and Bricks Builder.

= Does this plugin work without Bricks Builder? =

Yes, partially. The core WordPress tools (get_site_info, get_posts, get_post, get_users, get_plugins) work on any WordPress site regardless of the active theme. The Bricks-specific tools (get_bricks_page, create_bricks_page, update_bricks_page) require Bricks Builder to be installed and active.

= Which AI tools and clients are supported? =

Any MCP-compatible client can connect to this plugin. Verified clients include Claude Desktop and Claude Code. Because MCP is an open protocol, support for other clients is expected to grow over time.

= Is it safe to expose a REST API endpoint for AI access? =

Yes, when configured correctly. The plugin enforces WordPress Application Password authentication by default. Only users with the appropriate WordPress capabilities can use the tools. For extra security, you can restrict access by IP or role. Never disable authentication on a publicly accessible site.
